# Cure Better 

**Cure Better** is an AI-powered facial expression analysis tool designed to estimate **pain levels** in real time using a standard webcam.  
It leverages [MediaPipe FaceMesh](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_mesh), OpenCV, and custom feature extraction heuristics to calculate a **Pain Score (0–100)** and classify it into bands:  
- **Mild**
- **Moderate**
- **High**

Snapshots are automatically saved when high pain levels are detected.

## 🚀 Features
-  **Real-time webcam tracking** using MediaPipe FaceMesh  
-  **Pain score estimation** from brows, eyes, mouth, and forehead landmarks  
-  **Baseline calibration** – press `b` to capture your neutral face  
-  **Automatic snapshots** on high pain detection  
-  **Lightweight** – CPU-only, no GPU required

## 🛠 Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cure-better.git

 3.  Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Usage:
   Run the app:
   python cure_better.py

   Controls:

  Press b → capture baseline (neutral face, no smile/frown)
  
  Press ESC → quit
  
  Snapshots of high pain moments are stored in the snapshots/ folder

5. Output:

  On-screen overlay shows:
  
  Pain Score (0–100)
  
  Band classification (None / Mild / Moderate / High)

Debug dots drawn for forehead, brows, eyes, mouth, and cheeks
